				 English by birth, American at heart. <b>

			<p1> A little bit about myself </p1> 
			<h2>
				Who am I?
			</h2>	
			<p> I am an 18 year old College Student living in Sanford Maine. Although I have lived in Sanford for many years now, I was born and raised across the pond, in Stockport, England. I lived in England until I was 10, then moved to southern Maine with my faimily because we loved it here so much. I'm really just an average guy, going through the steps like everyone else. </p>
			<h2>
				Hobbies
			</h2>
			<p> I have many hobies, many of which are outdoor based- I love being outside. In the winter I'm a huge skiier, constantly hitting the slopes with my friends and family. I love backcountry skiing, zipping in and out of the trees and other natural features. In the summer I love to hike in the many trails and up the many beautiful moutains in our amazing region; I often take my dogs along with me! When it's not so nice out, I'm a big fan of just kicking it back with a few friends inside, hanging out playing xbox or listening to music.  </p>
			<h2>
				Family
			</h2>
			<p> I have an amazing family, quite a big one too. I have my wonderful mother and father, who have been with me from the very start, I also have 3 little sisters. There is Willow, the oldest at 13, Summer, who is 10, and Freya, who is just turning 4. Although my sisters can sometimes get on my nerves I like them very much, most of the time! </p>
			<h2>
				School
			</h2>
			<p> I am currently enrolled at UMaine in the school of business. I someday plan to become a sucsesful business owner, and I want to be very finacialy stable. Im also planning on taking a minor in botany, as it's somtimes that interests me greatly and could be of great use to me in the future. Im very excited for my years ahead in college, I know they're going to be a lot of fun. </p>
